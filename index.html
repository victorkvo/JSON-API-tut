    <h1>Updating a Resource</h1>

    <p>
      A resource can be updated by sending a PATCH request to the URL that
      represents the resource.
      <br />
      The URL for a resource can be obtained in the self link of the resource
      object.
      <br />
      Alternatively, when a GET request returns a single resource object as
      primary data, the same request URL can be used for updates.
      <br />
      The PATCH request MUST include a single resource object as primary data.
      The resource object MUST contain type and id members.
    </p>

    <br />
    In this example, the article 1 is being updated.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h1>Updating a Resource’s Attributes</h1>
    <p>
      Any or all of a resource’s attribute may be changed in a PATCH request.
      <br />
      Note: Any missing attributes will remain unchanged. The server MUST NOT
      have their values changed to null.
    </p>
    <img src="patch 3.PNG" alt="example" style="width: 600px; height: 300px" />
    <br />
    In this example, the “title” and “text attributes are being updated.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <h1>Updating a Resource’s Relationships</h1>
    <p>
      Similar to attributes, a Resource’s relationship may also be changed using
      a PATCH request.
      <br />
      Note: Any missing relationships will remain unchanged. The server MUST NOT
      have their values changed to null.
    </p>
    <img src="patch 4.PNG" alt="example" style="width: 600px; height: 300px" />
    <br />
    In this example, the “author” relationship is being updated.
